# 📄 Statement of the Project

## **Project Title:** Student Grade Calculator

## **Problem Statement**
Students and teachers often need a quick and simple way to calculate academic performance without manual calculations. Determining the total marks, percentage, and final grade for each student can be time-consuming and prone to errors. A simple automated system is required to make this process faster, easier, and error-free.

## **Proposed Solution**
The Student Grade Calculator is a Python application designed to automate the evaluation process. By entering the marks of five subjects, the program instantly calculates the total, percentage, and grade based on predefined criteria. The project also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter to provide a user-friendly experience.

## **Outcome**
The application helps users quickly generate accurate academic results, making it useful for students, teachers, and educational projects.
